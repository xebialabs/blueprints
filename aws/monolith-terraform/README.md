# Monolithic Application on Amazon ECS with Terraform

## Introduction

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a container orchestration service for Docker-enabled applications. It works with AWS Fargate, a compute engine that allows you to run containers on ECS without having to manage servers or clusters.

Use this blueprint to deploy a monolithic application on ECS with the Fargate launch type, using Terraform to define the infrastructure that will run on ECS. The release template that the blueprint generates will provision a new ECS cluster and deploy a sample application to it.
