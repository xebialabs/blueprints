# Data Lake Solution on Amazon EC2

## Introduction

AWS offers a sample Data Lake Solution that shows how you can store both structured and unstructured data in a centralized repository on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Use this blueprint to deploy the sample Data Lake Solution on EC2 using CloudFormation, which defines the infrastructure that will run on EC2. The release template that the blueprint generates will provision an EC2 instance, deploy the Data Lake Solution to it, and optionally tear the instance down.
