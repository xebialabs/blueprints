## Deploy the blueprint to the XL Platform

To deploy this blueprint to the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, follow the steps below:

1. Apply the generated YAML configuration using the XL CLI. Open up a terminal in the folder where you generated the configuration. Then run:

    ```plain
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
    ```

2. Go to XL Release and look for `{{$app}}` under Design and start a new release from it.

3. Once the template has been deployed, navigate to https://{{.AWSRegion}}.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region={{.AWSRegion}} and find the application. Click the URL to see the welcome page.
