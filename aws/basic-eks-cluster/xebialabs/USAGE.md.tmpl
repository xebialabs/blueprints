## AWS EKS Cluster

The blueprint deploys a simple AWS EKS Cluster.
XL Deploy does the provisioning and deployment, while XL Release orchestrates everything.

### Prerequisites

1. If you do not have XL Release and XL Deploy instances running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin them up.
Please note that you can obtain a trial license or bring your own license for XL Release and XL Deploy if you like. Follow the steps below to use the Docker Compose files.

    1. CD into the folder "docker" generated by the blueprint.
    2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.

To deploy this blueprint with the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, follow the steps below:

1. Apply the generated YAML configurations using the XL CLI.

    ```
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
    ```

2. Go to XL Release, look for the "{{$app}}-ci-cd" template, and start a new release from it.

### Using Amazon Elastic File System

The blueprint provisions an [Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) that can be used for your Kubernetes applications.

You would need to use an EFS provisioner and storage class definitions when deploying to your Kubernetes cluster. [Here](https://medium.com/faun/aws-eks-volumes-architecture-in-a-statefull-app-in-multiple-azs-6ca1b05f80eb) is a blog article demonstrating the concept. 

You can get the EFS ID from the XL Release pipeline once the provisioning is complete.
