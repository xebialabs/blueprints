# Microservice Application on Amazon EKS Usage

## Notes

* You can obtain a trial license or bring your own license for XL Release and XL Deploy if you like. Follow the steps below to use the Docker Compose files.

## Prerequisites

* You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your platform
* You must have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

### AWS-specific steps

Follow the instructions in the [aws/README.md](https://github.com/xebialabs/blueprints/blob/master/aws/README.md) on how to:

* Download and install the AWS CLI
* Obtain the necessary AWS Access and Secret Keys

### Environment variables

If you intend to use the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to generate your own Docker images, you will need to set the following environment variables before running `docker-compose up` in the same terminal session:

```plain
export GITHUB_USER=<your GitHub user name>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your GitHub access token, needed only if you are using a private repository, this variable can be skipped for public repositories>
export DOCKER_USER=<your Docker user name>
export DOCKER_PASS=<your Docker password>
```

{{if eq .GenerateDockerComposeSetup false}}
> **Note:** If you do not have XL Release and XL Deploy instances already running, you can re-run this blueprint and choose to generate a Docker configuration setup.
{{end}}

### Docker repository configuration

1. Replace the occurrences of `<your-dockerhub-user>` in the following files with your own DockerHub ID:

    * `notification/kubernetes/notification-deployment.yml`
    * `store/kubernetes/store-deployment.yml`
    * `invoice/kubernetes/invoice-deployment.yml`

2. Commit all changes and push this cloned repository to your GitHub account so that Jenkins can checkout `https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER}/e-commerce-microservice.git`.

{{if eq .GenerateDockerComposeSetup true}}
## Start XL Release and XL Deploy

CD into the `docker` folder generated by this blueprint. Then run:

```plain
docker-compose up
```
{{end}}

This will start the services and take control of the terminal. You will need to open a new terminal to continue.

### XL CLI

Watch the log output for `docker_xl-cli_1`. Its job is to connect XL Release to XL Deploy. It must exit with code `0`. If not, open a new terminal in the same directory and run:

```plain
docker-compose up -d xl-cli
```

## Deploy the blueprint to the XL Platform

To deploy this blueprint to the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, open up a terminal in the `e-commerce-microservice` folder where you generated the configuration. Then run:

```plain
xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
```

## Deploy to AWS

Go to XL Release and click on `{{$clusterName}}` under the 'Design' tab.

### Provision the CI/CD pipeline

1. Click 'New Release' under `{{$clusterName}}-ci-cd`.
    1. Give the Release a name.
    2. Click 'Create'.
    3. Click 'Start Release'.

## Undeploy from AWS

Go to XL Release and click on `{{$clusterName}}` under the 'Design' tab.

### Deprovision the CI/CD pipeline

1. Click 'New Release' under `{{$clusterName}}-destroy`.
    1. Give the Release a name.
    2. Click 'Create'.
    3. Click 'Start Release'.
