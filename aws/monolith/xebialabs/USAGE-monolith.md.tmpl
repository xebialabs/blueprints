## Monolith application on AWS ECS with Fargate

The blueprint deploys a monolithic application, generated with JHipster, to AWS ECS with the Fargate launch type.
XL Deploy does the provisioning and deployment, while XL Release orchestrates everything.

The application is available in the repo [https://github.com/xebialabs/e-commerce-monolith](https://github.com/xebialabs/e-commerce-monolith).

### Prerequisites

    1. CD into the folder "docker" generated by the blueprint.
    2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.
