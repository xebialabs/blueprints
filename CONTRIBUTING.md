### Unit tests

We use Travis CI to run unit tests against the blueprints. The script in `integration_tests.py` is used for testing and it can also be run locally if you have a Python 3 development environment. Just run `python3 integration_tests.py` on the root of the repository.

Tests are expected in a folder named `__test__` under each blueprint folder. You can have multiple test cases as long as each test case is in a YAML file with a name that starts with `test`. The test file is structured as below:

```
answers-file: answers-01.yaml
expected-files:
  - xebialabs.yaml
  - cloudformation/data-lake-api.yaml
  - xebialabs/USAGE.md
  - xebialabs/xld-environment.yaml
  - xebialabs/xld-infrastructure.yaml
  - xebialabs/xlr-pipeline.yaml
expected-xl-values:
  AWSRegion: us-east-2
expected-xl-secrets:
  AWSAccessKey: ANDGDJDHJHD4235
  AWSAccessSecret: ANDGDJDHJHD4235
```

The `answers-file` needs to be on the same `__test__` folder as well. The `answers-file` holds values for the parameters defined in `blueprint.yaml` file.
Here is a sample YAML for answers.

```
S3BucketName: my-s3-bucket
AdministratorName: admin
AdministratorEmail: admin@test.com
CognitoDomain: my-domain
UseAWSCredentialsFromSystem: false
AWSAccessKey: ANDGDJDHJHD4235
AWSAccessSecret: ANDGDJDHJHD4235
AWSRegion: us-east-2
```

`expected-xl-values` & `expected-xl-secrets` are optional.
