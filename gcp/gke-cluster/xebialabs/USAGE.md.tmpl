# GCP GKE cluster

The blueprint provisions a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster using Terraform and XL-Deploy.

## Prerequisites

### Authenticate to gcloud

Before configuring gcloud CLI you can check available Zones and Regions nearest to your location

```sh
gcloud compute regions list

gcloud compute zones list
```

Follow gcloud init and select default Zone Ex. europe-west1, make sure you use the same zone as the one selected during blueprint execution.

```sh
gcloud init
```

### Creating Google Cloud project and service account for terraform

Best practice to use separate account "technical account" to manage infrastructure, this account can be used in automated code deployment like in Terraform or XL-Deploy or any other tool you may choose.

> NOTE: You need to have proper permissions and privileges in the GCP account to execute these commands. If you are using a personal account you should be having these as you will be the admin. If you are using a company/enterprise account please check with your account administrator. 

#### Set up environment

> NOTE: If you are creating the Project via GUI instead of below commands, there will be a project number, a project name and a project ID when you initialize the project, and only ID should be exported as `TF_ADMIN` variable.

```sh
export TF_ADMIN=[GCP project ID]
```

#### Create the GCP Project

Create a new project and link it to your billing account (You could do it from the GCP console GUI as well, in that case skip the below command)

> NOTE: The value of YOUR_ORG_ID and YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID can be found by running below commands

```sh
gcloud organizations list

gcloud beta billing accounts list
```

Once you have the details run the below commands

```sh
gcloud projects create ${TF_ADMIN} \
--organization [YOUR_ORG_ID] \
--set-as-default

gcloud beta billing projects link ${TF_ADMIN} \
--billing-account [YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]
```

#### Create the Terraform service account

Create the service account in the GCP project and download the JSON credentials(This will be needed later for the blueprints):

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform \
--display-name "Terraform admin account"

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create account.json \
--iam-account terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Grant the service account permission to view the Admin Project and manage Cloud Storage

```sh
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/viewer
 
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/storage.admin
  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/compute.admin
  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/compute.networkAdmin
  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/container.admin
  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/container.clusterAdmin

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${TF_ADMIN} \
--member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
```

Enable APIs for the newly created project

```sh
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
    cloudbilling.googleapis.com \
    iam.googleapis.com \
    compute.googleapis.com \
    container.googleapis.com
```

## Creating back-end storage to store the `tfstate` file in Cloud Storage

Terraform stores the state about infrastructure and configuration by default in a local file `terraform.tfstate`. State is used by Terraform to map resources to configuration and to track metadata.

Terraform allows state file to be stored remotely, which works better in a team environment or automated deployments.
We will use Google Storage and create new bucket where we can store state files.

Create the remote back-end bucket in Cloud Storage for storage of the `terraform.tfstate` file.
Make sure you use the same zone as the one selected during blueprint execution in above command.

```sh
gsutil mb -p ${TF_ADMIN} -l europe-west1 gs://${TF_ADMIN}
```

Enable versioning for said remote bucket:

```sh
gsutil versioning set on gs://${TF_ADMIN}
```

## Using the blueprint

1. Generate the blueprint with `xl blueprint -b gcp/gke-cluster`
2. If you do not have an XL Deploy instance running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin it up.
Please note that you can obtain a trial license or bring your own license for XL Deploy if you like. Follow the steps below to use the Docker Compose files.

    1. CD into the folder "docker" generated by the blueprint.
    2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.

3. Ensure the "account.json" you downloaded earlier is placed inside the "terraform" folder that is created by the blueprint.


To deploy this blueprint with the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, follow the steps below:

1. Apply the generated YAML configurations using the XL CLI.

    ```
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
    ```

3. You can log into XL Deploy and provision a GKE cluster using the Application created

## Minimum Required versions

This blueprint version requires at least the below versions of the specified tools to work properly.

XL Deploy: Version 8.6.1
XL CLI: Version 8.6
