To apply the file generated by this blueprint, execute the following command:

{{ if ne .KubernetesApplicationName "nginx" }}
First, edit `kubernetes-application/deployment.yaml` to suit the `{{ .KubernetesApplicationName }}` image you chose to deploy.
{{ end }}

```
$ xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
```

Applying that XL YAML file will create:
* a `udm.DeploymentPackage` with a single `k8s.ResourcesFile` for the Kubernetes resource file that you specified.

Instantiate and apply one of the following blueprints to create an environment to which this application can be deployed:
* The `kubernetes/environment` blueprint will create an environment based on an existing Kubernetes cluster that is specified in your `~/.kube/config` file.
* The `azure/basic-aks-cluster` blueprint will provision an [AKS cluster in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) and then create an environment for it.
