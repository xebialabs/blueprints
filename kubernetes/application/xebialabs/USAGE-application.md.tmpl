# Kubernetes Application Blueprint Usage

## Notes

Instantiate and apply one of the following blueprints to create an environment to which this application can be deployed:

* The `kubernetes/environment` blueprint will create an environment based on an existing Kubernetes cluster that is specified in your `~/.kube/config` file.
* The `azure/basic-aks-cluster` blueprint will provision an [AKS cluster in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) and then create an environment for it.

{{if ne .DockerImage "nginx"}}
## Prerequisites

* Edit `kubernetes-application/deployment.yaml` to suit the `{{.DockerImage}}` image you chose to deploy.
{{end}}

## Deploy the blueprint to the XL Platform

To deploy this blueprint to the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, open up a terminal in the folder where you generated the configuration. Then run:

```plain
xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
```

Applying this XL YAML file will create:

* A `udm.DeploymentPackage` with a single `k8s.ResourcesFile` for the Kubernetes resource file that you specified
