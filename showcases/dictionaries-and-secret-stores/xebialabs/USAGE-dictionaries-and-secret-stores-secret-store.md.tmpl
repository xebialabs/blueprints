# Dictionaries and Secret Stores Usage
# Basic VM usage

This document describes how to use the blueprint you have just generated.

## Actions required

### Passwords and secrets

This blueprint requires that the DEV, TEST and PROD versions of the following secrets be entered into the {{$toolName}} secret store:

#### 1. `azure.clientsecret`

This is the password for the existing Azure client id you already entered.

#### 2. `azure.ospassword`

When creating the blueprint, you were prompted for an OS username for the VM that will be created. This is the OS password that will be created.

#### 3. `azure.resourcegroup`

You must enter a different resource group name for DEV, TEST and PROD.

{{if eq .GenerateDockerComposeSetup true}}
## Start XL Deploy and XL Release using `docker-compose`

Please follow the instructions in `USAGE-docker-compose.md`.

{{else}}
### 1. Make sure XL Deploy and XL Release are running and accessible

Since you are providing your own instances of XL Deploy and XL Release, make sure these are running and accessible.
{{end}}

## Deploy the blueprint to the XL Platform

To deploy this blueprint to the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, open up a terminal in the folder where you generated the configuration. Then run:

```plain
xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
```

{{if eq .SecretStoreLocation "docker"}}
## Edit the Docker files for {{$toolName}} and add the necessary passwords

{{if eq .SecretStoreTool "cyberark-conjur"}}
Please follow the instructions in `USAGE-cyberark-conjur.md`.
{{else if eq .SecretStoreTool "hashicorp-vault"}}
Please follow the instructions in `USAGE-hashicorp-vault.md`.
{{end}}
{{else}}
## Make sure the keys and passwords are captured in your own instance of {{$toolName}}

Since you are providing your own instance of {{$toolName}}, make sure the above keys and their associated secret values have been entered and are available.

Please follow the instructions in `USAGE-secret-store.md`.

{{end}}
