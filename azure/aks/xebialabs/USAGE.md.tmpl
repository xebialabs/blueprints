## Provision simple AKS cluster on Azure

### Prerequisites

If you do not have an XL Deploy instance running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin it up.

    1. CD into the folder "docker" generated by the blueprint.
    2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.

To deploy this blueprint, follow the steps below:

1. Apply the generated YAML configurations using the XL CLI. Open up a terminal and CD into the folder where you generated the configuration.

    ```
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
    ```

2. Go to XL Deploy, look for the `{{$clusterName}}` folder under Applications. Select the `1.0.0` item two levels underneath, click on the ellipsis and select 'Deploy'. Select the terraform environment (there should be only one), press 'Deploy'.

3. After the deployment process is complete, an AKS cluster will have been provisioned on Azure and a configured `K8s.master` environment will have been registered in XL Deploy.

4. In order to deploy to the k8s cluster, you can execute any k8s blueprints to generate configurations, apply those and deploy the application to your new cluster using XL Deploy.

5. Whenever you want to deprovision the AKS cluster, you can go to the terraform environment under Environment, select the `{{$clusterName}}-aks` item, press the ellipsis and select 'Undeploy' and follow the instructions on screen.
