{{$clusterName := .ClusterName | kebabcase}}

## Notes
* This example does not create a namespace, but uses the `default` namespace
* It creates an admin user called `adminuser` and generates the user's TLS key:
  * Find the key in XL Deploy dictionary `Environments` > `aks-{{$clusterName}}` > `{{$clusterName}}-terraform-module-dictionary` with the key: `admin_private_key`
* You will also find the API host url and access token under the same dictionary as above

## Provision simple AKS cluster on Azure

### Prerequisites

If you do not have an XL Deploy instance running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin it up:

1. Open up a terminal in the folder where you generated the configuration and `cd docker`. Then run:

```plain
docker-compose up
```

To deploy this blueprint, follow the steps below:

1. Apply the generated YAML configurations using the XL CLI. Open up a terminal in the folder where you generated the configuration. Then run:

```plain
xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
```

2. Go to XL Deploy, look for the `{{$clusterName}}` folder under Applications. Select the `1.0.0` item two levels underneath, click on the ellipsis and select 'Deploy'. Select the terraform environment (there should be only one), press 'Deploy'.

3. After the deployment process is complete, an AKS cluster will have been provisioned on Azure and a configured `K8s.master` environment will have been registered in XL Deploy.

4. In order to deploy to the k8s cluster, you can execute any k8s blueprints to generate configurations, apply those and deploy the application to your new cluster using XL Deploy.

5. Whenever you want to deprovision the AKS cluster, you can go to the terraform environment under Environment, select the `{{$clusterName}}-aks` item, press the ellipsis and select 'Undeploy' and follow the instructions on screen.
