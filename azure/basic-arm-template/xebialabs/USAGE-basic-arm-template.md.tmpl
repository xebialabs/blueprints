## Notes
* This blueprint will create the {{.ResourceGroup}} Resource Group and place everything under it.
* When you undeploy, the Resource Group will be completely deleted
* The deployment will fail if the Resource Group already exists, to guard against deploying to, and destroying, an existing Resource Group
