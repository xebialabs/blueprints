## Introduction

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications in the cloud using Kubernetes.

Use this blueprint to provision a simple AKS cluster using Terraform, which defines the infrastructure that will run on AKS.

## Before you get started

If you're new to XebiaLabs blueprints, check out:

* [Get started with DevOps as Code](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-platform/concept/get-started-with-devops-as-code.html)
* [Get started with blueprints](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-platform/concept/get-started-with-blueprints.html)
* [Get started with XL JetPack](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-platform/concept/get-started-with-xl-jetpack.html)

## Usage

To use this blueprint, run `xl blueprint` in an empty directory and select:

```plain
azure/basic-aks-cluster
```

## Tools and technologies

This blueprint includes the following tools and technologies:

* Target:
    * [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)
* Tools:
    * [XebiaLabs Deployment Automation](https://xebialabs.com/products/xl-deploy/)
    * [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
    * [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)


## Minimum required versions

This blueprint version requires at least the following versions of the specified tools to work properly:

- XL Deploy: Version 8.6.1
- XL CLI: Version 8.6.0

## Prerequisites

To run the YAML that this blueprint generates, you need:
* Azure login credentials in order to create the cluster
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/). Ensure that you are [signed in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

### Create a functional user under your subscription

You must configure the Azure provider with the `subscription_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret` and `tenant_id`. If you do not have these details you can use the `az` command line tool to obtain them.

> Note: Ensure that you have the [AZ CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) and you are [signed in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

Once you are signed in, run the command below to see a list of accounts you can access:

```plain
$ az account list
```

Example results:
```json
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "5dses33-f595-3333-6666-77788889997",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "Free Trial",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "7f3c634b-3ds4-23fe-8aa7-dme3jdwejqdxv",
    "user": {
      "name": "user@email.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

The `id` you see here is your `subscription_id`. Copy that value and paste it in the command below to create a functional user that has privileges to spin up a managed K8s cluster.

```plain
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

Example results:

```json
{
  "appId": "99999-0000-8888-7777-888877776755",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2019-04-19-17-32-40",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2019-04-19-17-32-40",
  "password": "77778888-7788-9998-92fc-huoui89889",
  "tenant": "7f3c634b-3ds4-23fe-8aa7-dme3jdwejqdxv"
}
```

In this output:
* `appId` is your `client_id`
* `password` is your `client_secret`
* `tenant` is your `tenant_id`

> Note: You already retrieved your `subscription_id` in the previous step.
