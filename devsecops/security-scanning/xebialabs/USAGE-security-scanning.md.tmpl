# Run Your DevSecOps Pipeline Usage

### Prerequisites

If you do not have XL Release instance running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin it up.
Please note that you can obtain a trial license or bring your own license for XL Release if you like. Follow the steps below to use the Docker Compose files.

1. CD into the folder `docker` generated by the blueprint.
2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.

## Notes

### Simple security and compliance template and dashboard

Security and compliance are critical aspects of product release.

Organizations struggle to track application release status information and understand security & compliance risks across many different applications, teams, and environments. When risk assessment, security testing, and compliance checks arenâ€™t built into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, releases fail and cause delays, security vulnerabilities threaten production, and IT governance violations result in expensive fines.

This blueprint provides a way to integrate tools like SonarQube, Fortify, Checkmarx, and Black Duck into release pipeline.

{{- if .ConfigureSonar}}
#### SonarQube

SonarQube is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities in application source code.
{{- end}}

{{- if .ConfigureFortify}}
#### Fortify SSC

Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) provides centralized management of their application security testing. Security teams use SSC to review and manage security testing activities, prioritize remediation efforts based on risk potential, measure improvements and generate cross portfolio management reports.

#### Fortify on Demand

Fortify on Demand provides software security analysis as a service. It can evaluate application code against selected security metrics.
{{- end}}

{{- if .ConfigureCheckmarx}}
#### Checkmarx

Checkmarx provides Checkmarx Static Application Security Testing (CxSAST) and Checkmarx Open Source Analysis (CxOSA). CxSAST automatically scan uncompiled code and identify security vulnerabilities. CxOSA provides a way to control and manage open source components and mitigate potential risks to the application, organizations and its users.
{{- end}}

{{- if .ConfigureBlackduck}}
### Black Duck

Black Duck provides a complete open source management solution. It can identify potential security risks, license risks and operational risks for open source components.
{{- end}}

## Deploy the blueprint to the XL Platform

To deploy this blueprint to the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, open up a terminal in the folder where you generated the configuration. Then run:

```plain
xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
```

## Deploy the template

Go to XL Release and click on `{{$app}}` under the 'Design' tab.

### Provision the template

1. Click 'New Release' under `{{$app}} security & compliance`.
    1. Give the Release a name.
    2. Click 'Create'.
    3. Click 'Start Release'.

## Extras

* Check the latest status using 'Design' > `{{$app}}` > 'Dashboards' tab > 'Security and Compliance'.
